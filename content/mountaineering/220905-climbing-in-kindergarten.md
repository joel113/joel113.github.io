[Kindergarten](https://www.thecrag.com/de/klettern/germany/oberbayern/area/252544161) is a wall in the [Stie Alm Kessel](https://www.thecrag.com/de/klettern/germany/oberbayern/area/252536526) at [Brauneck](https://www.thecrag.com/de/klettern/germany/oberbayern/area/252533556). Last week, on 4.9.2022, we went to the Kindergarten for some climbing. The Brauneck can be reached via Lenggries in the south of munich. In order to reach the Stie Alm Kessel a walk of 1.5 hours with an elevation gain of about 950 meters in heigth is needed. As an alternative it is also possible to take the cable car and walk around 20 minutes from the cable car station to the Stie Alm Kessel. It is actually very worthwhile to do the walk or the cable car ride up their. Kindergarten is only one of many walls in the Stie Alm Kessel, but it is the wall with the most easy routes. Additionally to Kindergarten there are more walls with more difficult routes. At Kindergarten, the routes are not very challenging, but versatile and well secured. The routes give a good feeling for climbing outdoors, especially as Kindergarten has some multi rope tours. I did enjoy climing their, but the next time I would definitely start early to have more time for climbing in the Kindergarten.
