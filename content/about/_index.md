I am Johannes from Munich, Germany. This is my personal web page where I want to share my endeaveurs in Tech, Craft, Running, Cycling and Mountaineering. In my professional life I am a data and software engineering. In my leisure time I do running, cycling and mountaineering as well as doing craft such as baking bread.

This page is build with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/), which is an open source static site generator. This page is served by a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
