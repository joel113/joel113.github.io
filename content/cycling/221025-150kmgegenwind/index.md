I like cycling in my area, but cycling becomes an adventure when I start to leave the known grounds and go somewhere where I have not been with my bicycle before. This does not necessarily mean that I have to go somewhere far far away. It is enough ride in one direction, not return to the starting point, but to finish somewhere else.

In October, I did cycle from Munich to the wonderful town of Ochsenhausen. I am very familiar with the route until Landsberg am Lech, but from Landsberg on it was unfamiliar ground. Ochsenhausen is not Bavaria anymore. Ochsenhausen is Baden-Württemberg and located in the outskirts of Schwaben.

This time the ride itself was mostly pain. I had almost the full ride (about 150 km) headwind with wind speeds up to 40 kmh. However, you simply want to do the ride even if it means to ride with 150 km headwind. In the end it was a big joy, because I finished, because I explored routes where I did not cycle before, because I was again amazed how beautiful it is to explore by bicycle and because sometimes even the strongest headwind at some point vanishes. It was beautiful to see how everything is changing when you leave Bavaria and when you are heading into Schwaben.

Although I said I will never do such a thing again (mostly because of the headwind), it is guaranteed that I will do it again (but with tailwind).
