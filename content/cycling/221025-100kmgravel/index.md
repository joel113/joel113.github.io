The gravel cycle tour "100 km Starnberger See, Ammersee and Café de la Montaña" is something what I can recommend. It is one of the fines routes in the southwest of Munich and brings you to some of the highlights of the outskirts of Munich. The highlights of this ride is

- the Starnberger See,
- the Maisinger Schlucht,
- the Kloster Andechs,
- the Ammersee and
- Gauting.

For cycling especially the part between Leutstetten and Starnberg, between Starnberg and Maising, between Kloster Andechs and Ammersee as well as between Seefeld and Hochstadt is especially beautiful.

We did this route in October 2022 and we enjoyed it. We did take it easy. We did start early to finish it before the rain in the afternoon. We discovered beautiful places like the Café de la montaña to have a cappuchino and a spezi and bumped into events like a [running event at Kloster Andechs](https://www.lk-starnberg.de/B%C3%BCrgerservice/Sport/Landkreislauf/).

Cycling is such a joy, especially if there is such a nice route.
