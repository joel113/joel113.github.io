It was about time to cycle once more to cycle from Munich to Ochsenhausen. This year, the opportunities to cycle a longer route were non existing so far. There was the Supermarathon Rennsteiglauf 2023, there was a lot of rain and cold temperatures and there was a move within Munich. But on Pfingstsamstag I had the long-awaited opportunity to grab my bike and cycle again the 150 km to Ochsenhausen. Last year, the last time I did this ride it was mostly pain due to the head wind. This year, I was mostly pleasure due to the tail wind. Ochsenhausen is in the east of Munich and due to the typical wind from the west it is quite unusual to have some tail wind.

This time, I did plan a different route more in the north through the towns of Buchloe and Mindelheim. However, this time, I also discovered a [newly paved bicycle path through the forest](https://www.komoot.de/highlight/4712518) to Landsberg am Lech which was an unexpected beautiful discovery.

I like cycling in my area, but cycling becomes an adventure when I start to leave the known grounds and go somewhere where I have not been with my bicycle before. This does not necessarily mean that I must go somewhere far far away. It is enough ride in one direction, not return to the starting point, but to finish somewhere else. I was amazed by the beautiful town of Holzhausen bei Buchloe and Buchloe itself. Everything was fine, until I was heading into Baden-Würrtemberg. In Baden-Württemberg it was again difficult to find good routes without too many cars to go to Ochsenhausen. Next time, I need another look into the [RadNETZ](https://www.aktivmobil-bw.de/radverkehr/radnetz/das-radnetz/) and the [RadROUTENPLANER BW](https://vm.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/mobilitaet-verkehr/radverkehr/radwege/radroutenplaner-bw) to have a better choice. However, sometimes I think, that the reality does not meet the claims of these pages and that the bicycle routes and lanes are not simply as good as they can be.
