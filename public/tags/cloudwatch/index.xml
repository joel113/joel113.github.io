      <description>AWS offers with CloudWatch a powerful service to observe a AWS infrastructure and applications which are running on the AWS infrastructure. Collecting and querying metrics is a major part of observing infrastructure and applications. When I was working with querying AWS CloudWatch metrics I did found out that AWS CloudWatch acutally provides to ways to query the metrics and that is important to know that two ways are available:
CloudWatch Metrics Insights with a SQL kind query language Cloudwatch search expressions CloudWatch query expressions from Metrics Insights ðŸ”—CloudWatch Metrics Insight offers a rich sql kind query language to build queries on top of time series data.</description>
