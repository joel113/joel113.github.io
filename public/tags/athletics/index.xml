      <description>The European Championships did take place from 11th August of 2022 until 21st August of 2022. I did volunteer at a supply station of the marathon event and visited a whole bunch of other events. The crowds were amazing, especially during the mens combined lead and bolder event as there were no german climbers in the final and still the crowd did support every athlete. You will find pictures of triathlon relay, marathon, climbing, beach volleyball, moutainbike, cycling and athletics.</description>
